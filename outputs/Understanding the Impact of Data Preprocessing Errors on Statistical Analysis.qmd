# **Understanding the Impact of Data Cleaning Errors on Statistical Analysis**

## **Introduction**

Accurate data preparation, including collection and preprocessing, is pivotal for the reliability of statistical analysis outcomes. However, intentional or unintentional errors during these stages can significantly bias and distort the representation of the underlying data distribution. In this paper, we examine the effects of data cleaning errors on statistical inference using a simulated dataset. We simulate a scenario where the true data generating process follows a Normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation. Subsequently, we introduce errors during the data preprocessing stage to mimic real-world data issues. We aim to assess the impact of these errors on estimating the mean of the true data generating process and discuss strategies to mitigate such errors in practice.

## Data Simulation and Preprocessing Errors

In our simulation, we generate a dataset comprising 1,000 observations drawn from a Normal distribution, with a mean and standard deviation set to one. To replicate common data preparation pitfalls, we introduce three distinct errors: memory limitation errors in the data collection instrument, human error during data cleaning, and coding errors in data preprocessing. Specifically, the instrument's memory limitation error leads to the overwriting of the final 100 observations with the first 100, simulating a technical constraint often overlooked in real-world settings. Human error is simulated by instructing a research assistant to inadvertently alter half of the negative values to positive, introducing a bias. Lastly, coding errors are mimicked by inaccurately adjusting decimal places for values between 1 and 1.1, a subtle yet impactful mistake in data handling.

## Effect of Errors on Statistical Analysis

Next, we analyze the impact of these errors on estimating the mean of the true data generating process. Due to the truncation error, the repeated observations at the end of the dataset skew the distribution, potentially inflating the estimated mean. The alteration of negative values to positive values introduces noise and biases the mean estimate. Additionally, the incorrect adjustment of decimal places distorts the distribution of values between 1 and 1.1, further affecting the mean estimation. Overall, these errors collectively lead to an inaccurate estimation of the true mean. Real-life analogs of these errors include transcription mistakes in data entry, software limitations in data recording devices, and programming bugs in data processing scripts, each capable of leading to erroneous analytical conclusions.

## **Inferential Analysis**

Next, we conduct inferential analysis to determine whether the mean of the true data generating process is greater than 0. We formulate hypotheses and perform hypothesis testing, comparing the sample mean to the hypothesized population mean of 0. However, it is crucial to consider the potential biases introduced by the data cleaning errors and their impact on the validity of our statistical inference.

## Mitigation Strategies

To counteract the influence of data preparation errors, we recommend a multifaceted approach. Initially, comprehensive data validation and verification processes must be instituted at both the collection and preprocessing stages, allowing early detection and correction of inaccuracies. Employing statistical methodologies robust against outliers and data anomalies can further safeguard analytical results from preprocessing inaccuracies. Finally, the integration of automated data quality controls and validation scripts offers a systematic means to identify and address potential data issues before they impact the analysis, ensuring higher integrity and confidence in the statistical findings.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, this paper highlights the importance of accurate data preprocessing in statistical analysis and demonstrates the potential impact of preprocessing errors on mean estimation using a simulated dataset. The errors introduced during data collection and preprocessing stages can significantly distort the underlying data distribution and lead to biased inference. By understanding the effects of these errors and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, researchers can enhance the reliability and validity of their statistical analysis in real-world scenarios.
